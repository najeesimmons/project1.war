/*-------GAME RULES--------*/
The objective of the game is to win all of the cards.

The deck is divided evenly among the players, giving each a down stack. 

In unison, each player reveals the top card of their deck -— this is a 
"battle" —and the player with the higher card takes both of the cards 
played and moves them to their stack. Aces are high, and suits are 
ignored, joker is highest of all.

If the two cards played are of equal value, then there is a "war".

At this time, the winner of each war will be randomly selected. 

The stretch protocols for war will be as follows:

Both players place the next three cards face down and then another 
card face-up. The owner of the higher face-up card wins the war 
and adds all the cards on the table to the bottom of their deck.
If the face-up cards are again equal then the battle repeats with 
another set of face-down/up cards. This repeats until one player's 
face-up card is higher than their opponent's.

If a player runs out of cards during "war" he automatically loses.
